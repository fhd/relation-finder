Release goals for 0.1:
======================
- Implement the fetcher (http://soci.sourceforge.net/).
- Write a db creation script.
- Thoroughly scan for memory leaks and fix them.
- Provide the compulsory --help and --version commandline options.
- Read the daemon's port, the db fetching interval and the search algorithm's
  depth limit from commandline options.
- Handle symbols properly, especially SIG_TERM


Ideas
=====
- Use the boost graph library (Or not? Looks cumbersome).
