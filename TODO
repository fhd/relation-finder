Release goals for 0.1:
======================
- Implement the fetcher (http://soci.sourceforge.net/).
- Handle unix signals properly, especially SIGTERM.
- Thoroughly scan for memory leaks and fix them.
- Use a configuration file for certain things (e.g. db access)


Ideas
=====
- Use the boost graph library (Or not? Looks cumbersome).
