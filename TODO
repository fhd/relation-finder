Release goals for 0.1:
======================
- Improve the jam file, have targets "all", "test" etc.
- Implement the fetcher (http://soci.sourceforge.net/).
- Handle unix signals properly, especially SIGTERM.
- Thoroughly scan for memory leaks and fix them.


Ideas
=====
- Use the boost graph library (Or not? Looks cumbersome).
