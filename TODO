Release goals for 0.1:
======================
- Implement the fetcher (http://soci.sourceforge.net/).
- Write a db creation script.
- Thoroughly scan for memory leaks and fix them.
- Handle unix signals properly, especially SIGTERM


Ideas
=====
- Use the boost graph library (Or not? Looks cumbersome).
