wbd - Wanjas Beziehungs Daemon

A daemon calculating the shortest path between two people in a social network.

This is open source software, licensed under the MIT license.
See the file COPYING for details.


ABOUT
=====
wbd regularly fetches the relationships between people from the database of a
social networking site.
It listens for incoming network connections asking for the shortest path
between two people (via other people) and calculates it.

This is a rewrite of the infamous "Wanjas Beziehungs Daemon" because that one
did apparently have some memory leak problems I was unable to detect.
Instead of Qt, this one uses the boost C++ libraries, which I consider a
more reasonable approach for a daemon.
The search algorithm should be better too, I created it while studying the
subject intensively :)


COMPILING
=========
This is what you'll need in order to build wbd yourself:

Boost (at least version 1.34)
In particular, the following libraries:
- Boost.Asio
- Boost.Assignment
- Boost.Foreach
- Boost.Filesystem
- Boost.Program_options
- Boost.Thread
- Boost.Test
You will also need Boost.Build (AKA bjam).

The PostgreSQL C++ library (pqxx) (at least version 2.6)

On a Debian system, the required packages are:
- libboost-dev
- libasio-dev
- boost-build
- libpqxx-dev

Once you've made sure that everything is in place, type:
bjam release

After the build process is finished, the desired binary (wbd) resides
in dist/bin.


RUNNING
=======
You'll need a properly set up PostgreSQL database; to get one with
some test data, execute doc/setup_db.sql.

After compiling wbd, you've automatically built a couple of programs:
- wbd	-- the daemon itself
- wbdc	-- a very simple client documenting wbd's protocol

What you'll want to do is run wbd. To see how it's used, execute:
wbd --help

You'll have to set at least the database connection parameters.

If you want to see if it's working properly, use wbdc.

To run wbd, the libraries listed under COMPILING are required.
Their headers, Boost.Test and Boost.Build are not.

On a Debian system, the packages are:
- libboost-thread
- libboost-program-options
- libboost-filesystem
- libpqxx


INSTALLING
==========
To install everything, just invoke the following command:
bjam release -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

To install just wbd (recommended), execute:
bjam release wbd -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

If you would like to remove it for some unreal reason, invoke:
bjam clean -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

You can of course use whichever directory you like instead of /usr/local.
