wbd - Wanjas Beziehungs Daemon

A daemon calculating the shortest path between two people in a social network.

This is open source software, licensed under the MIT license.
See the file COPYING for details.


ABOUT
=====
wbd regularly fetches the relationships between people from the database of a
social networking site.
It listens for incoming network connections asking for the shortest path
between two people (via other people) and calculates it.

This is a rewrite of the infamous "Wanjas Beziehungs Daemon" because that one
did apparently have some memory leak problems I was unable to detect.
Instead of Qt, this one uses the boost C++ libraries, which I consider a
more reasonable approach for a daemon.
The search algorithm should be better too, I created it while studying the
subject intensively :)


COMPILING
=========
This is what you'll need in order to build wbd yourself:

Boost (at least version 1.34)
In particular, the following libraries:
- Boost.Asio
- Boost.Assignment
- Boost.Foreach
- Boost.Filesystem
- Boost.Program_options
- Boost.Thread
- Boost.Test

You will also need Boost.Build (AKA bjam).

On a Debian system, the required packages are:
- libboost-dev
- libasio-dev
- boost-build

Once you've made sure that everything is in place, type:
bjam

After the build process is finished, the desired binary (wbd) resides
in dist/bin.


RUNNING
=======
After compiling wbd, you've automatically built a couple of programs:
- wbd	-- the daemon itself
- wbdc	-- a very simple client documenting wbd's protocol

What you'll want to do is run wbd. To see how it's used, execute:
wbd --help

If you want to see if it's working properly, use wbdc.


INSTALLING
==========
To install everything, just invoke the following command:
bjam -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

To install just wbd (recommended), execute:
bjam wbd -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

If you would like to remove it for some unreal reason, invoke:
bjam clean -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

You can of course use whichever directory you like instead of /usr/local.
