relation-finder

A daemon that finds the shortest path between two people in a social
network.

This is open source software, licensed under the MIT license.
See the file COPYING for details.

ABOUT
=====

relation-finder regularly fetches the relationships between people
from the database of a social networking site.  It listens for
incoming network connections asking for the shortest path between two
people (via other people) and calculates it.

COMPILING
=========

This is what you'll need in order to build relation-finder yourself:

Boost (at least version 1.34)
In particular, the following libraries:
- Boost.Asio
- Boost.Assignment
- Boost.Foreach
- Boost.Filesystem
- Boost.Program_options
- Boost.Thread
- Boost.Test
You will also need Boost.Build (AKA bjam).

The PostgreSQL C++ library (pqxx) (at least version 2.6)

On a Debian system, the required packages are:
- libboost-dev
- libboost-filesystem-dev
- libboost-program-options-dev
- libboost-thread-dev
- libboost-test-dev
- libasio-dev
- boost-build
- libpqxx-dev

Once you've made sure that everything is in place, type:
bjam release

After the build process is finished, the desired binary
(relation-finder) resides in dist/bin.

RUNNING
=======

You'll need a properly set up PostgreSQL database; to get one with
some test data, execute doc/setup_db.sql.

After compiling relation-finder, you've automatically built a couple of
programs:
- relation-finder		-- the daemon itself
- relation-finder-client	-- a very simple client documenting
				   relation-finder's protocol

What you'll want to do is run relation-finder. To see how it's used,
execute:
relation-finer --help

You'll have to set at least the database connection parameters.

If you want to see if it's working properly, use
relation-finder-client.

To run relation-finder, the libraries listed under COMPILING are
required. Their headers, Boost.Test and Boost.Build are not.

On a Debian system, the packages are:
- libboost-thread
- libboost-program-options
- libboost-filesystem
- libpqxx

INSTALLING
==========

To install everything, just invoke the following command:
bjam release -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

To install just relation-finder (recommended), execute:
bjam release relation-finder -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

If you would like to remove it for some unreal reason, invoke:
bjam clean -s DIST_DIR=/usr/local

You can of course use whichever directory you like instead of /usr/local.
