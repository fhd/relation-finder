WBD - Wanja's Beziehungs Daemon

A daemon calculating the shortest path between two people in a social network.

This is open source software, licened unter the conditions of the MIT license.
See the file COPYING for details.


ABOUT
=====
WBD regularly fetches the relationships between people from the database of a
social networking site.
It listens for incoming network connections asking for the shortest path
between two people and calculates it based on their transitive relationships.

This is a rewrite of the infamous "Wanjas Beziehungs Daemon" because that one
did apparently have some memory leak problems I was unable to detect.
Instead of Qt, this one uses the boost C++ libraries, which I consider as a
more reasonable approach for a daemon.
The search algorithm should be better too :)


COMPILING
=========
This is what you'll need in order to build WBD yourself:

Boost (at least version 1.34)
In particular, the following libraries:
- Boost.Thread
- Boost.Asio
- Boost.Test

You will also need Boost.Build (AKA bjam).

On a Debian system, the required packages are:
- libboost-dev
- libasio-dev
- boost-build

Once you've made sure that everything is in place, type:
bjam

After the build process is finished, the desired binary - wbd - resides
somewhere in bin/src.


RUNNING
=======
After compiling WBD, you've automatically built a couple of programs:
- wbd	-- the daemon himself
- wbdc	-- a very simple client

What you'll want to do is run WBD. In order to do that, just execute it.
It will then run as a daemon, listening on port 8888 for incoming connections.

If you want to see if it's working properly, use wbdc.
